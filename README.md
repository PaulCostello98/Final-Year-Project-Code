# Final-Year-Project-Code
Code used to demonstrate the effects of an external electric field on an electrostatic Vlasov Plasma. Code adapted from https://github.com/JuliaVlasov/Numkin2019 by Pierre Navaro to include electrostatic fields and additional diagnostic features, such as energy and entropy conservation plots.

An electrostatic Vlasov plasma is modelled using a Vlasov-Ampere system, with a Fourier Advection numerical scheme.
